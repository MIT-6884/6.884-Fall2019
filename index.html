    <h2 class="module-header">Course description</h2>
    <p>Welcome to an exploration of computational challenges in the design of human therapeutics.  We will explore computational methods in the design and analysis of therapeutics, including small molecules, biologics, cell based therapies, and synthetic biology approaches.   Lectures will present essential computational methods on molecular design and optimization drawing upon recent results in machine learning.  Classes will include presentations by students on recent research results related to the computational design of therapeutics and efficacy.   Problem sets will explore computational methods for therapeutic design.  Topics include protein design, antibody optimization, small molecule design and characterization, and the engineering of viruses and cell lines for therapeutic effect. Experts from industry will present on their views of the promise of computational approaches, what is working, and what is needed.
    </p>

    <p>As part of the subject students taking the graduate version  will use cloud resources to implement solutions to problems in therapeutic design, first in problem sets that span a carefully chosen set of tasks, and then in an independent project. You will be programming using Python 3 and TensorFlow 1.12 in Jupyter Notebooks on the Google Cloud, a nod to the importance of carefully documenting your work so it can be precisely reproduced by others.</p>
